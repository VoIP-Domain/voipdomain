## What is interact.js?

interact.js is a JavaScript library for drag and drop, resizing and multi-touch
gestures for modern browsers. Its free and open source version comes with
powerful options like inertia and modifiers for snapping and restricting.

The library's aim is to **present pointer input data consistently** across
different browsers and devices and provide convenient ways to **pretend that the
user's pointer moved in a way that it wasn't really moved** (snapping, inertia,
etc.).

Note that by default **interact.js doesn't move elements for you**. Styling an
element so that it moves while a drag happens has to be done from your own event
listeners. This way, youâ€™re in control of everything that happens.

a look at <a href="/pro">interact.js Pro</a>. It comes with built-in hardware
accelerated feedback, list reordering, spring physics, Vue & React components
and more.

## Getting Started

After [installing the library](/docs/installation), the basic steps to setting
up your targets and interactions are:

1.  Create an `Interactable` target.
2.  Configure it to enable actions and add [modifiers](/docs/modifiers),
    [inertia](/docs/inertia), etc.
3.  Add event listeners to provide visual feedback and update your app's state.

For example, here's some code for [a very simple slider
input](https://codepen.io/taye/pen/GgpxNq):

<LiveDemo :demoHtml="import('@/demos/slider.html?raw')" :removeNext="1"/>

```js
// Step 1
const slider = interact('.slider')    // target elements with the "slider" class

slider
  // Step 2
  .draggable({                        // make the element fire drag events
    origin: 'self',                   // (0, 0) will be the element's top-left
    inertia: true,                    // start inertial movement if thrown
    modifiers: [
      interact.modifiers.restrict({
        restriction: 'self',           // keep the drag coords within the element
      }),
    ],
  })
  // Step 3
  .on('dragmove', function (event) {  // call this listener on every dragmove
    const sliderWidth = interact.getElementRect(event.target.parentNode).width
    const value = event.pageX / sliderWidth

    event.target.style.paddingLeft = (value * 100) + '%'
    event.target.setAttribute('data-value', value.toFixed(2))
  })
```

The `interact` function takes an element or a CSS selector string and returns an
`Interactable` object which has various methods to configure actions and event
listeners. Pointer interactions of down â†’ move â†’ up sequences begin drag,
resize, or gesture actions. By adding event listener functions for these action,
you can respond to `InteractEvent`s which provide pointer coordinates, speed,
element size, etc.

## Actions

interact.js supports 3 basic action types which are triggered by pointer down â†’
move â†’ up sequences:

- [Draggable](/docs/draggable) for moving elements or drawing on a canvas.
  This can be combined with [dropzones](/docs/dropzone) to implement drag and
  drop applications.
- [Resizable](/docs/resizable) for watching the size and position of an
  element while the pointer is used to move one or two of the element's edges.
- [Gesturable](/docs/gesturable) for 2-finger gestures with angle, scale, etc.
  data.

Pro builds on the draggable action to provide [Sortable and
Swappable](/docs/sortable) feature for drag and drop rearranging of lists of
elements.
