## Element Dragging

A common feature of interfaces using jsPlumb is that the elements are draggable. You should use the `draggable` method 
on a `jsPlumbInstance` to configure this:

```javascript
myInstanceOfJsPlumb.draggable("elementId");
```

...because if you don't, jsPlumb won't know that an element has been dragged, and it won't repaint the element.

#### Allowed argument types

`draggable` supports several types as argument:

- a String representing an element ID
- an Element
- any "list-like" object whose contents are Strings or Elements. 

A "list-like" element is one that exposes a `length` property and which can be indexed with brackets (`[ ]`). Some examples are:

- arrays

```javascript
jsPlumbInstance.draggable(["elementOne", "elementTwo"]);
```

- jQuery selectors

```javascript
jsPlumbInstance.draggable($(".someClass"));
```

- NodeLists

```javascript
var els = document.querySelectorAll(".someClass");
jsPlumbInstance.draggable(els);
```

#### Options

If you absolutely cannot use `jsPlumb.draggable`, you will have to arrange to repaint the drag element manually, via 
`jsPlumb.revalidate`.

Note `jsPlumb` is an instance of the `jsPlumbInstance` class. If you are working with your own instances of jsPlumb, be 
sure to call the draggable method on those instances, not the global instance.

##### Vanilla jsPlumb

In vanilla jsPlumb, drag support is provided by a bundled library called Katavorio. Katavorio supports drag containment 
and constraining elements to a grid, as well as drag/drop of multiple elements.

<a name="css"></a>
#### Required CSS

You *must* set `position:absolute` on elements that you intend to be draggable. The reasoning for this is that all 
libraries implement dragging by manipulating the left and top properties of an element's style attribute.

When you position an element absolute, these `left`/`top` values are taken to mean with respect to the origin of this 
element's `offsetParent`, and the `offsetParent` is the first ancestor of the element that has `position:relative` set 
on it, or the body if no such ancestor is found.

When you position an element relative, the `left`/`top` values are taken to mean _move the element from its normal 
position by these amounts_, where "normal position" is dependent on document flow. You might have a test case or two 
in which relative positioning appears to work; for each of these you could create several others where it does not.

You cannot trust relative positioning with dragging.

<a name="containment"></a>
#### Drag Containment

A common request is for the ability to contain the area within which an element may be dragged. Vanilla jsPlumb offers 
support for containing a dragged element within the bounds of its parent:

```javascript
jsPlumb.draggable("someElement", {
   containment:true
});
```

<a name="grid"></a>
#### Dragging on a Grid

To constrain elements to a grid, supply the size of the grid in the `draggable` call:

```javascript
jsPlumb.draggable("someElement", {
    grid:[50,50]
});
```

<a name="nested"></a>
#### Dragging nested elements

jsPlumb takes nesting into account when handling draggable elements. For example, say you have this markup:

```xml
<div id="container">
  <div class="childType1"></div>
  <div class="childType2"></div>
</div>
```

...and then you connect one of those child divs to something, and make container draggable:

```javascript
jsPlumb.connect({
  source:$("#container .childType1"),
  target:"somewhere else"
});

jsPlumb.draggable("container");
```

Now when you drag `container`, jsPlumb will have noticed that there are nested elements that have Connections, and they 
will be updated. Note that the order of operations is not important here: if container was already draggable when you 
connected one of its children to something, you would get the same result.

##### Nested Element offsets

For performance reasons, jsPlumb caches the offset of each nested element relative to its draggable ancestor. If you 
make changes to the draggable ancestor that will have resulted in the offset of one or more nested elements changing, 
*you need to tell jsPlumb about it*, using the `revalidate` function.

Consider the example from before, but with a change to the markup after initializing everything:

```xml
<div id="container">
  <div class="header" style="height:20px;background-color:blue;">header</div>
  <div class="childType1"></div>
  <div class="childType2"></div>
<div>
```

Connect a child div to some element and make it draggable:

```javascript
jsPlumb.connect({
  source:$("#container .childType1"),
  target:"somewhere else"
});

jsPlumb.draggable($(".childType1"));
```

Now if you manipulate the DOM in such a way that the internal layout of the container node is changed, you need to 
tell jsPlumb:

```javascript
$("#container .header").hide();    // hide the header bar. this will alter the offset of the other child elements...
jsPlumb.revalidate("container");   // tell jsPlumb that the internal dimensions have changed.
// you can also use a selector, eg $("#container")
```

Note in this example, one of the child divs was made draggable. jsPlumb automatically recalculates internal offsets 
after dragging stops in that case - you do not need to call it yourself.

<a name="multiple"></a>
#### Dragging Multiple Elements

Vanilla jsPlumb, because it uses Katavorio as its drag library, supports dragging multiple elements at once. There are two
ways to do this.

##### The drag selection

Every jsPlumb instance has an associated `dragSelection` - a set of elements that are considered to be "selected" (and
 which have a CSS class assigned to them to indicate this fact). Any drag event occurring in the instance will cause the 
 currently selected elements to be dragged too.  
 
 There are three methods provided to work with the drag selection:

- **addToDragSelection: function (elements)** Add the specified elements to the drag selection.
- **removeFromDragSelection: function (elements)** Remove the specified elements from the drag selection
- **clearDragSelection** Clear the drag selection.

As previously mentioned, these methods are all provided by [Katavorio](https://github.com/jsplumb/katavorio).

Here, `elements` can be a single element Id or element, or an array of either of these (or, in fact, a jQuery selector,
since jsPlumb knows that selectors are "list-like").

##### Posses

Since jsPlumb 2.0.0 there is another way of configuring multiple element drag - the concept of a `posse`. This is a
group of elements that should all move whenever one of them is dragged. This mechanism is intended to be used for more
"permanent" multiple drag arrangements - you may have a set of nodes that should always move together and they do
not need to be considered to be "selected". 

You can define multiple posses in an instance but each element can belong to one posse only. Three methods are provided
for working wth Posses:

- **addToPosse(elements, posse...)**

Here, `elements` can be a single element Id or element, or an array of either of these (or, in fact, a jQuery selector,
since jsPlumb knows that selectors are "list-like"). `posse` is required, and is a varargs parameter: you can provide
 more than one.  Each `posse` parameter can either be a String, indicating a Posse to which the element should be added
 as an active drag participant, or an object containing the Posse's ID and also whether or not the element should be an
 active drag participant. 
 
For example, in the Flowchart demo, we could make these couple of calls:

```javascript
jsPlumb.addToPosse(["flowchartWindow1", "flowchartWindow2"], "posse");
jsPlumb.addToPosse("flowchartWindow3", {id:"posse",active:false})
```

And the result would be that whenever window 1 or 2 was dragged, all of windows 1, 2 and 3 would be dragged. But if 
 window 3 was dragged, it would be dragged alone; windows 1 and 2 would not move.

- **removeFromPosse(elements, posseId)**

Remove the given element(s) from Posse(s). As with `addToPosse`, the second parameter is a varargs parameter: you can
supply a number of posse IDs at once:

```javascript
jsPlumb.removeFromPosse("flowchartWindow1", "posse1", "posse2");
```

- **removeFromAllPosses**
 
Remove the given element(s) from all of the Posses to which it/they belong.
 
```javascript
 jsPlumb.removeFromAllPosses("flowchartWindow1");
 jsPlumb.removeFromAllPosses(["flowchartWindow2", "flowchartWindow3"]);
```

<a name="selection"></a>
#### Text Selection while dragging

The default browser behaviour on mouse drag is to select elements in the DOM. To assist with handling this, this class is 
attached to the body at drag start:

`jtk-drag-select`

The class is removed at drag end.

A suitable value for this class (this is from the jsPlumb demo pages) is:

```css
.jtk-drag-select * {
    -webkit-touch-callout: none;
    -webkit-user-select: none;
    -khtml-user-select: none;
    -moz-user-select: none;
    -ms-user-select: none;
    user-select: none;    
}    
```
