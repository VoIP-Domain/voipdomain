Configuring Asterisk server:
----------------------------

You must use asterisk 21 or 22 series (recommended serie 22, because it's the
current LTS serie).

The Asterisk server configuration is done including the VoIP Domain bootstrap
files for each required configuration file.

Just install a fresh new Asterisk server and include the lines below in each
configuration file:
- agents.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/agents.conf
- extensions.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/dialplan.conf
- musiconhold.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/musiconhold.conf
- pjsip.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/pjsip.conf
- pjsip_notify.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/pjsip_notify.conf
- queues.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/queues.conf
- voicemail.conf:
  #include voipdomain/bootstrap/voicemail.conf

You can also execute the "configure-asterisk.sh" script available in the
/etc/asterisk/voipdomain/ directory to do this job.
