Notes:
  - The firmware upgrade process is a really mess. You need to have a lot of patience with commands without immediatelly return, that look's like it's not working or not started. When the upgrade starts, it takes a very long time (took more than 30 minutes to me) with a lot of reboots. Also, take attention that the hardware MAC address was changed when upgrading from 2.0.X to 2.42.X firmware!
  - Dialplan support second dial tone (same dialtone), but it's buggy to implement, because it removes the code that preceed second dial tone and keep looking for the rest of number. If we implement the dialplan without the outline prefix, could conflict with extensions.
