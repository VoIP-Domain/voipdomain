- If you really need to keep an Asterisk server visible at Internet, be sure to:
  * Use strong passwords (at least 8 characters, lower and upper case letters, numbers and special characters);
  * Change your user passwords periodically (every 2 to 3 months at most);
  * Prefer to enable only TLS port, and enforce use of SRTP;
  * Try to block call's to unusual destinations.
- At sip.conf under the general section, use "alwaysauthreject = yes". This setting make's Asterisk reply with authentication error insted of not found even if peer didn't exist.
